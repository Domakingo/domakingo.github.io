## 🎮 How to Play

The rules of TicTacToeTWIST are simple:

1. The game is played on a circular grid consisting of 4 rings, each with 8 cells.
2. Players take turns selecting a cell to mark with their color.
3. The objective is to be the first to align 4 cells of the same color vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
4. Here comes the TWIST! During your turn, you have 3 opportunities to rotate any ring of your choice, changing the board's configuration.
5. Use the ring rotations strategically to block your opponent or create new opportunities for yourself.
